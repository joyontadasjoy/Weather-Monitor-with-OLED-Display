# Weather-Monitor-with-OLED-Display
: 

Smart Weather Station
This project is a smart weather station that measures temperature, humidity, and sunlight intensity. It also calculates the "feels like" temperature and displays a comment on the weather. The data is displayed on an OLED display.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Arduino IDE
DHT11 sensor library
Adafruit SH1106 OLED display library
Hardware Requirements
Arduino Uno
DHT11 sensor
LDR sensor
OLED display
Installing
Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
Open the Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for and install the following libraries:
DHT11 sensor library
Adafruit SH1106 OLED display library
Connect the DHT11 sensor and LDR sensor to the Arduino Uno as shown in the circuit diagram.
Connect the OLED display to the Arduino Uno as shown in the circuit diagram.
Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

Usage
After uploading the code to the Arduino Uno, the weather data will be displayed on the OLED display. The "Feels like" temperature will be used to display a comment on the weather, which will be either "It is hot today" or "The weather is okay" depending on the temperature.
